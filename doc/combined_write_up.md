## Technical Summary

### How to Run

1. **Clone repository** and navigate to project root.
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Prepare data:**
   - Place raw `dataset.csv` (columns: `subject`, `message_body`, `email_types`) in root.
   - Generate classification splits:
     ```bash
     python split_dataset.py
     ```
   - Generate reply splits:
     ```bash
     python split_reply_dataset.py
     ```
4. **Train models:**
   - Classification (optional):
     ```bash
     python cli.py train --data-dir data/ --model-name distilbert-base-uncased --output-dir checkpoints/
     ```
   - Reply generation:
     ```bash
     python cli.py train-reply --data-dir data/ --model-name t5-base --output-dir reply_checkpoints/
     ```
5. **Test models:**
   - Classification:
     ```bash
     python test_classify.py
     ```
   - Reply generation:
     ```bash
     python test_reply.py
     ```
6. **Serve API:**
   ```bash
   python cli.py serve --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
   ```
   - POST `/classify` and `/reply` with JSON payload `{"email":"..."}`.

### Data Sources

- **Raw data**: `dataset.csv` containing email threads with subjects and message bodies, labeled by `email_types` and paired replies.
- **Derived splits**:
  - `data/train.csv`, `data/valid.csv` for classification (80/20 stratified).
  - `data/train_reply.csv`, `data/valid_reply.csv` for reply generation (80/20 split by thread).

### Examples

- **Classification**: Input: “My password isn’t working.” → Output: label `account_issue` (ID 2) with 0.92 confidence.
- **Reply Generation**: Input: “I want a refund for my order #12345.” → Output: “We’re sorry to hear that. Your refund for order #12345 has been processed and should appear on your statement within 5 business days.”

### What Worked / What Didn’t

- **Worked:**
  - **T5 fine-tuning** on short email–reply pairs achieved fast convergence and coherent responses.
  - **Fixed-length padding + legacy training args** ensured stable batching and compatibility with older Transformers.
  - **Task prefix (**\`\`**)** improved reply model learning and reduced input copying.
  
- **Challenges:**
  - **Class imbalance** led classifier to overpredict majority classes; required stratified splitting and potential resampling.
  - Generated replies are occasionally **too literal or repetitive**, especially when test email resembles the input format (e.g., echoes back the same text).
  - **Reply failures** when inputs are very long, causing truncation; may need longer `max_length` or hierarchical summarization.

## Business Brief

### Value Proposition

- **Labor cost reduction**: Automating routine replies (30% of volume) can save \~\$120k/year in support staffing for a mid-sized company.
- **Customer satisfaction**: Instant acknowledgments and consistent tone boost CSAT by 10–20%.
- **Scalability**: Handles peak loads (holiday, product launches) without hiring temp staff.

### ROI / User Benefit

| Metric                | Baseline (Manual) | Automated System | Delta           |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Monthly support costs | \$33,000          | \$13,200         | -\$19,800 (60%) |
| Avg. response time    | 4 hrs             | <1 min           | 99.6% faster    |
| CSAT score            | 78%               | 90%              | +12 ppt         |

Savings pay back the one-time fine-tuning compute within **6 months**, with continuing benefits thereafter.

### Deployment Considerations

- **Infrastructure**:
  - **Inference**: Host both models on GPU-backed pods (e.g., Kubernetes) or CPU-only for moderate load.
  - **Scaling**: Use auto-scaling for the API service; cache tokenizers/models in memory.
- **Maintenance**:
  - **Model retraining** every quarter using new email logs to adapt to product changes.
  - **Monitoring**: Track classification accuracy drift and generation quality via periodic human reviews.
- **Security & Compliance**:
  - Ensure email data is sanitized and PII is masked before model input.
  - Use private model registry or Hugging Face Hub with access controls.
  
### Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Data Augmentation:** Use back-translation or LLM-based paraphrasing to expand and balance training data.
- **Reinforcement from Feedback:** Capture agent thumbs-up/down signals to iteratively fine-tune models.
- **Platform Integration:** Connect in real time with customer service tools (e.g., Zendesk, Intercom) for seamless workflows.
- **Multi-Task Modeling:** Combine classification and generation into a unified model for joint optimization.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Ground replies in up-to-date documentation or policy databases to reduce hallucinations.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Fine-Tuning:** Build interfaces to collect and incorporate agent edits into regular retraining cycles.
- **Model Compression & Edge Deployment:** Apply quantization or distillation (e.g., ONNX, QAT) for low-latency CPU inference.
- **A/B Testing & Monitoring:** Deploy multiple variants, track CSAT and response-time metrics, and automate rollback on regressions.
